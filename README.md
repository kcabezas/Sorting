# Sorting
Program to implement various sorting methods.

Things to note:

-This was a homework assignment for the class CS 1332 Data Structures & Algorithms, which I took in Fall 2015.

-The class provided the classes Sorting and SortingStudentTests. Sorting came with blank methods that had to be filled in with the appropriate code. SortingStudentTests came with JUnit test cases made by the classes teaching assistants so that the students would be able to test their code.
